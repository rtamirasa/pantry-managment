# Pantry Management

Pantry Management is a web application designed to help users efficiently manage their pantry inventory. Built using modern web technologies like Next.js, React, and Firebase, this project aims to provide a seamless experience for tracking and organizing pantry items, reducing food waste, and ensuring that users are always aware of the items they have on hand.

## About the Project

### Key Features
- **Real-time Inventory Tracking**: Users can add, update, and delete items from their pantry in real-time, with changes instantly reflected in the app.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily search for specific items or filter the pantry list based on categories such as expiry date, type of food, or quantity.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: The app can send reminders when items are nearing their expiration date, helping users minimize waste.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Firebase, allowing users to create and manage their personalized pantry lists.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Provides the foundation for the app with its powerful features like server-side rendering and API routes.
- **React**: Allows for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time database management, user authentication, and hosting. Firebase makes it easy to synchronize data across different users and devices.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with a clean and consistent design.

### Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **`/app`**: Contains the core pages of the application, including the main pantry management interface.
- **`/components`**: Reusable React components used across different parts of the app, such as forms, lists, and notifications.
- **`/lib`**: Utility functions and API calls that interact with Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
- **`/styles`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.
- **`/public`**: Static assets like images and fonts.

### Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered various challenges, such as implementing real-time updates with Firebase and managing state effectively across different components. These challenges provided valuable learning experiences, particularly in areas like state management with React's Context API and optimizing performance for large datasets.
